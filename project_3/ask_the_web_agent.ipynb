    "[Chainlit](https://chainlit.io/) is a Python library designed specifically for building LLM and agent UIs. It provides:\n",
    "- Built-in streaming support\n",
    "- Message history\n",
    "- Step visualization (see tool calls as they happen)\n",
    "- No frontend code required\n",

    "1. You write a Python file named `chainlit_app.py` with the agent creation logic as well as UI handlers (e.g.,`@cl.on_message`)\n",
    "2. Run the file in your terminal with `chainlit run app.py`\n",
    "3. A web UI opens automatically at `http://localhost:8000`"
